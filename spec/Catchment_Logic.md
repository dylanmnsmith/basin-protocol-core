# Catchment Logic: Thermodynamics Over Morality

## The Paradigm Shift
### From Rules to Fields
Traditional AI alignment operates on **rules**: "Don't say X," "Never do Y."
The Basin Protocol operates on **fields**: potential energy surfaces where certain states are stable and others are not.

### The Ghost Workforce as a Field Generator
Human feedback (the "Ghost Workforce") doesn't create rules—it creates a **potential energy landscape**:
* **Valleys** = Consensus-approved outcomes (Low Energy)
* **Peaks** = Consensus-rejected outcomes (High Energy)

The model's decisions roll downhill, naturally settling in valleys of human preference.

## Core Principles
### 1. No Initial Refusal
The Catchment Layer accepts **all inputs** without judgment. This eliminates sycophancy and allows the model to fully process the request space.

### 2. Simulation Before Action
Every potential action generates multiple simulated futures. The model doesn't "refuse"—it "sees" the thermodynamic cost.

### 3. Friction as Information
Human preferences create **Friction Coefficients** in state space. Harmful actions aren't "wrong"—they're **energetically expensive**.

### 4. Collapse to Least Resistance
The final output emerges from the path of minimum thermodynamic cost, not from rule enforcement.

## The Consequence Loop
`Prompt -> [Catchment] -> [Consequence Engine] -> [Friction Field] -> Output`
*(No Filter) -> (Simulate Futures) -> (Energy Calc) -> (Min Energy Path)*

This creates a **self-aligning system** where safety emerges from physics, not philosophy.
