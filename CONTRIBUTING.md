# Contributing to Basin Protocol

We are building a **thermodynamic framework** for AI alignment, not another rules-based filter.

## Contribution Areas
### 1. Mathematical Formalization
* Refine the friction function `L_friction(s)`
* Prove convergence properties

### 2. Implementation
* Better simulation algorithms
* Efficient basin topology storage

## Code Standards
* Follow PEP 8
* Type hints required
* Tests required
